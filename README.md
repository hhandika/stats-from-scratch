# Statistics from Scratch
This is my pandemic mood-driven project aimed for teaching myself the fundamental of statistics. The goal is to implement statistical computation in multiple programming languages that I am comfortable on using. This way it will give me enough repetition to understand the concept. That is the phylosophy behind it. The truth, though, I just need a little distraction during this pandemic madness. 

There is no deadline when I will finish it. There is no guarantee I will finish it either. Nonetheless, I do hope that this library will serve these purposes:
1. As a teaching material, at least for me. Other people are also welcome to use it. 
2. A reference for other people who interested on learning statistics through code.
3. A code reference for those who already knew statistics.

Of course, I will be grateful if it can be used beyond what I layout above.

## Implementation

## State of Code
The code is still at its infancy. I tend to write C code first and continue with Rust. The rest of the languange implementation will come in a random order depending on my mood that day. Usually, higher level languages will show up later in the process. Todo:
1. Refactor the code. Maybe use traits in rust and write TypeScript in OOP.
2. Change the default implementation to floating points. Current implementation is in integer 32-bit.
