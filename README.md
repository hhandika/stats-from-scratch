# fun-data-science
Data science statistics from scratch written in multiple programming languages. The goal is to use only the language standard library to solve data science problems.

## State of Code
The code is still at its infancy. I tend to write C code first and continue with Rust. The rest of the languange implementation will come in a random order depending on my mood that day. Usually, the higher level language will show up later in the process. Todo:
1. Refactor the code. Maybe use traits in rust and write TypeScript in OOP.
2. Change the default implementation to floating points. Current implementation is in integer 32-bit.
